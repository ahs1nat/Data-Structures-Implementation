# Data-Structures-Implementation
This repository contains my implementations of core data structures (arrays, linked lists, stacks, queues, binary search trees etc.). These were implemented as part of the coursework for CSE 105: Data Structures and Algorithms I at BUET.
Along with the data structure implementations, the assignments also included problems that apply these structures and the solutions to the problems are also included here.
