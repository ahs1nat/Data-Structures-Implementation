# Data-Structures-Implementation
This repository contains my implementations of core data structures (arrays, linked lists, stacks, queues, binary search trees, hash tables, red black tree, AVL tree). These were implemented as part of the coursework for CSE 106: Data Structures and Algorithms I and CSE 208: Data Structures and Algorithms II at BUET.
Along with the data structure implementations, some assignments also included problems that apply these structures and the solutions to the problems are also included here.
